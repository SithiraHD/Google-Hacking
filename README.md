## How to Hack security cameras using Google Search

There's nothing more tedious, yet exciting, than watching surveillance cameras at work. They prey on the innocent and the unknowing. They protect businesses, workplaces, and homes. They catch criminals in the act, find hilarious anomalies, and are just darn cool when you're not the one that's supposed to be eavesdropping with them.

Well, how exactly do you watch a security camera that isn't yours? Google.

This video tutorial from Digital Fx Cube shows you how to hack security cameras using Google Search. Yep, that's rightâ€¦ no one is safe now, not with millions of viewers.

You can easily do a quick Google Search for any unsecured surveillance cameras on the web. The links send you to the camera's video. Not all of the links work though, but when they do, some of the user controls actually allow you to "control" the actual video camera. Cool, huh?

## How to Hack someone's web cam or online security camera.

This tutorial will let you hack into a wide selection of web cams and online security cameras. The hack is actually quite easy, and is best done with a browser like Mozilla Firefox. Navigate to Google in your browser, and then type in "inurl:viewerframe?mode+refresh". This piece of code will open up a list of active webcams. Then just surf through your choices and watch whatever you want. You can even change the camera angle and zoom in and out of the picture!

## Hackers Have 92% Success Rate Hacking Gmail on Android

Researchers at the University of California, Riverside and the University of Michigan announced recently that they have developed a hack that works 92% of the time on Google's Gmail system on Android, as well as with the H&R Block app.

In addition, this hack worked 86% of the time on Newegg, and 83% of the time at Chase Bank and Hotels.com. That's a highly reliable hack as far as hacks go. Probably most troubling is its reliability against the Chase Bank app.

The key to the hack is to get the user to download a malicious app. As you know, apps on the Android system are not vetted like the apps on Apple's iOS, and as such, some malicious apps do appear in the Google Play Store.

When this fake or malicious app in on an Android system, it then monitors the legitimate app, such as Chase Bank. When the user opens the legitimate app, it inserts a fake login screen where the user then enters their credentials. Furthermore, the researchers were able to grab a photo on the check deposit to the Chase app.

The keys to this hack are several and should not be that hard to replicate by black hats. First, the end user needs to be enticed to download a malicious app. This isn't that hard, as people are often downloading free apps that they know nothing about. A "free" version of a popular paid app will likely entice millions to download it.

Second, the malicious app needs to detect when the user is opening the victim app. This is not that hard, as each app has its own signature (much like how AV software works) that can be detected by the malicious app and then launch the appropriate login screen.

In the case of the check deposit on the Chase app, as soon as you enable your camera on your phone, it shows the video of everything in its viewfinder. This action can be detected by the app and will launch its intercept of the check picture when the picture is "snapped."

You can see how it works in their demo video below.
